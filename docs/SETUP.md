## What You Need

### 1. Node.js
Download from https://nodejs.org — install the LTS version.
Verify: `node --version` → should show v18+ or v20+

### 2. Anthropic API Key
- Go to https://console.anthropic.com
- Create account → API Keys → Create Key
- Starts with `sk-ant-...`
- Cost: ~$0.02–0.05 per full job scan (5 roles scored)
- New accounts get $5 free credit (~100–250 scans free

### 3. Jooble API Key (for live Australian jobs)
- Go to https://jooble.org/api/about
- Register (free)
- Copy your API key
- **Without this key:** the app uses realistic mock data — still useful for testing

## Tips

- **Update your CV** as you close gaps — run the score again and see it move
- **Try different role titles** — "Solution Architect" vs "Enterprise Architect" vs "Principal Architect" shows where the market actually wants you
- **Try different regions** — Brisbane vs Sydney vs "Australia" vs "Remote" shows geographic demand
